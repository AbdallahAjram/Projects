# Hotel Management System

## Overview

This project is a Hotel Management System developed during my internship at CodeAlpha. It is built using Java Swing for the user interface and integrates with a database to manage hotel information and customer ratings.

## Features

- **Hotel Listings**: Displays a list of hotels along with their locations and average ratings.
- **Hotel Ratings**: Allows customers to rate hotels and view average ratings.
- **Authentication**: Secure login system with error handling for incorrect passwords and duplicate hotel entries.

## Technologies Used
