## About the Project

**Find My Dorm** aims to solve the problem of scattered, outdated dorm rental information for students.  
The app provides a centralized, easy-to-use platform where:
- Students can browse available dorms based on location, price, and facilities.
- Dorm owners can list their properties with images and detailed descriptions.
- Users can manage their personal profiles and listings.

The application uses a MySQL database and a PHP-based backend for storing and retrieving data through REST APIs.
